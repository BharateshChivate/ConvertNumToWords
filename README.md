# ConvertNumToWords
This program converts the entered numbers to word format(UK system)

I have used 2 approaches to solve this.
1. By using extension method for a long data type.
2. By using oops concepts. Basically i have designed this as a singleton design pattern.

I have used MS Test Framework to write the test cases.

I could not use Oops concepts extensively as this is a very simple program.
